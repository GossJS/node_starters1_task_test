the app is functioning

now we have to test it

steps 1, 2, 3 take us closer to the idea

(see further on client testing, promisifyin Zombi)

and we run `./node_modules/babel-cli/bin/babel-node.js 3.js`

and enjoy async/await in action.

And then we take it to another level of abstraction

cuz this should.be.or.have DSL testing language is much of an abstraction

and we say yarn test

and the same thing is run under mocha

You then try to do the same with Jest!
